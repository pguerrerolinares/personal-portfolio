      "p1": "Computer engineer with a solid foundation in backend and frontend development, evolved into a rare hybrid profile: someone who codes, understands architecture, masters complex pipelines, and operates in strict security environments.",
      "p2": "Notable for designing and maintaining high-level pipelines, especially in OCR, computer vision, and multimodal language models. Building solutions with docTR, PaddleOCR, LayoutLMv3, and Qwen3-VL, deploying them in on-prem Kubernetes while meeting strict security requirements.",
      "p3": "Beyond coding, I understand Scrum from the inside, participate in refinements, write clear user stories, manage technical debt, and anticipate sprint risks. The goal is not just working software, but a working team."
